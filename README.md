# Stack-Based Expression Evaluator

## Description
This project implements a stack-based expression evaluator in C. It converts
infix expressions into postfix notation and evaluates postfix expressions using
stack operations.

## Features
- Infix to Postfix conversion.
- Postfix expression evaluation.
- Stack implementation using arrays.
- Menu-driven program.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- Stack Data Structure
- Arrays

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Choose options from the menu to convert or evaluate expressions.

## Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of stack operations.
- Expression parsing and evaluation.
- Algorithmic problem solving using C.
